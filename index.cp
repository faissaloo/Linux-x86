      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>x86 is the main architecture used for computers nowadays (others exist&#44; such as PowerPC and ARM) however&#44; the wide majority of programmers don't understand how everything works under the hood&#44; as such they often don't make the most of the abundance of computing power available to them.</p>

        Please note that this website deals exclusively with x86 and not x86_64.
